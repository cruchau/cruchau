I'm Arnaud from London, and I do dashboard and algorithms and process creation at Amazon. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like python and sklearn, as well as building ML algo from scratch and deep diving all their possibilities or variant. And I also collect and clean data via sql to better fit my model goal.

Skills: LINUX/ PYTHON / GIT / SQL 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on linear model
